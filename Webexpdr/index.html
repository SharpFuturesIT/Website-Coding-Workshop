This employs both Web development and Graphical design skills. We greatly value the importance of the early design process of web development.

            <h2 class="sp1">Our Past</h2>
            <p class="sp1">We have made a Website for a Slovakian charity based in south Manchester called Slovenskè Vzadelávacie Centrum Manchester. This was a multipage website, the pages included being: Home/About us, Membership sign up (with a functional form for creating an account and logging in), Event history and Significant dates (complete with an interactable calendar where information displayed would be relevant to events taking place on specifc dates). Before reaching out to us this charity only promoted itself via social media, namely instagram and Facebook. They wanted a hub for users to interact with them, being able to sign up, get informed and get into contact with the charity in one organised place. We worked closely with our client, working on schedule and through changes in demands by the client. The process itself took us around 3 weeks and by the end we had created a 4 page website. In which users can get involved, learn about the charity and their goals as a charity, along with get into direct contact for any enquiries they may have, whether it be volunteering, Receiving support from the charity or wanting to support the charity themselves. Slovenskè Vzadelávacie Centrum Manchester was greatly satisfied with our work and the website we provided, along with this the Charity has seen a steady increase in memberships, donations and overall engagement since we worked together.</p>
